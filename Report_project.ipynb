    "## Paper description\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper points out that developing learning algorithms that are robust across tasks and policy representations remains a\n",
    "challenge. While standard benchmarks like MuJoCo and Atari provide rich settings for experimentation, but the specifics of the underlying environments differ from each other in multiple ways, and thus determining the principles underlying any particular form of sub-optimal behavior is difficult. To evaluate the success of the alorithms we try on those environments, we usually uses **high scores** to determine those which are more performant, but it would be more interesting to look at **optimal behavior**, which is unfortunately not fully characterized and generally complex on this type of environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The article proposes an new environment to better evaluate generalization, it is based on the work of Erdos and Selfridge, and Spencer. Erdos-Selfridge-Spencer (ESS) games are turn-based games where two players play adversarly. The cool thing is that **optimal behavior** (or strategy) can be defined by **potential functions** derived from conditional expectations over random future play.\n",
    "\n",
    "They chose to focus on a very well-known game type in the Reinforcement Learning, the **attacker-defender game**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game is composed, at the beginning, of $N$ identical pieces ditributed on a board of $K$ levels. We are only interested of the level of each piece. Two assymetrical players compete: the ***attacker*** and the ***defender***. A turn of the game goes the following way :\n",
    "\n",
    "- The attacker separates the pieces in two sets $A$ and $B$ both with at least one piece.\n",
    "- The defender chooses one set to destroy and all pieces of the remaining set move up of one level.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attacker wins if **one (ore more) piece reaches the top**, and the defender wins if **all pieces are removed** or it remains only one piece on a level strictly below $K$.\n",

    "\n",
    "ESS games offer a nice field to experiment with RL techniques, because there exists several theoretical results which make evaluation of performance easier.\n",

    "Let us start with a definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition : potential function**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider a state $\\mathcal{S} = (n_1, ..., n_k)$ where $n_i$ is the number of pieces in level $i$. We define then the ***potential*** of $\\mathcal{S}$, noted $\\phi(\\mathcal{S})$ by the following function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\phi(\\mathcal{S}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{K}n_i2^{-(K-i)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reminder** : $K$ represents the number of levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The potential is a key metric for results and strategies of ESS games.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The possible outcomes and optimal strategies are in the following theorems:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theorem 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let an instance of the ESS game with $N$ pieces and $K$ levels randomly placed on the board, and $\\mathcal{S}_0$ the initial state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If $\\phi(\\mathcal{S}_0)<1$, the defender can always win\n",
    "- If $\\phi(\\mathcal{S}_0)\\geq1$, the attacker can always win\n",
    "\n",
    "If all pieces start at the bottom, this condition $\\phi(\\mathcal{S}_0)<1$ transforms to $N<2^K$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theorem 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal strategy for the defender is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For the two proposed parts $A$ and $B$, compute $\\phi(A)$ and $\\phi(B)$.\n",
    "- Eliminate the part with the highest potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the rest of the work we will call *random* policy the policy where the defender chooses randomly between the sets $A$ and $B$, and the *optimal* policy the policy where it plays in an optimal way."

    "## Our approach\n",
    "\n",
    "While the authors decided to create an environment based on the ESS using **[gym](https://gym.openai.com/)** (an **openAI** library for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms on famous environments like **Cartpole** or **Pong**) and compare openAI algorithms on the new environment, we decided not to follow their path.\n",
    "\n",
    "We didn't think it was interesting to develop a gym-compatible ESS environment, and then use the already-made RL algorithms like DQN, PPO or A2C like what was done by the authors. It would have required some time to get use to the gym library and potentially come across errors unrelated to Reinforcement Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "We felt like we would learn much more on RL by developing our own RL algorithm on a non-gym ESS environment, that we would thus create from scratch and by doing so, allow us to focus on our algorithm.\n",
