# ReinforcementLearningProject

The goal of the project is to implement what was done in a [research paper about Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.02301.pdf) which focuses on a specific game, the Erdos-Selfridge-Spencer Game, and see how well state-of-the-art algorithms perform.
