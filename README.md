# ReinforcementLearningProject

The goal of the project was to take inspiration from what was done in this [research paper about Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.02301.pdf) which focuses on a specific game, the Erdos-Selfridge-Spencer Game, and see how well state-of-the-art algorithms perform.

#### What we did

- We developed our own ESS game environment without using [gym](https://gym.openai.com/), an **openAI** library where famous environments like Cartpole or Pong are available.
- We trained a defender against a random attacker using a reinforcement learning algorithm. We used the **Monte-Carlo** method for policy evaluation and policy control without exploring start.
