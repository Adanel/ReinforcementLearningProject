# ReinforcementLearningProject

The goal of the project is to implement what was done in a [research paper about Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.02301.pdf) which focuses on a specific game, the Erdos-Selfridge-Spencer Game, and see how well state-of-the-art algorithms perform.

#### TODO

- Code a naive ESS Game
- Train a defender, evaluate performance and generalization vs naive
- Train an attacker, evaluate performance and generalization vs naive
- Selfplay ?
